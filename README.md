# Chat

This repository contains code of the FriendlyChat project in the [Firebase in a Weekend: Android by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-android--ud0352) Udacity course with my additions.

## Overview

Chat is an app that allows users to send and receive text and photos in realtime across platforms.

## Setup

It uses firebase services, so requires creating a Firebase project. See https://firebase.google.com/ for more information.
